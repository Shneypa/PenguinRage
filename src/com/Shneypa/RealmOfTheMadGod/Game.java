/* REWATCH: 
 * Episode 76  11:40.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * ERROR LOG
 *
 * ARRAY OUT OF BOUND EXCEPTIONS:
 * 1) Into the Sprite Constructor we passed a spriteSheet which was 96x128   but misplaced the order of width and height values  (passed parameters of 128 x 96 instead of  96 x 128) 
 *  ERROR WAS HERE :  public static SpriteSheet bard = new SpriteSheet("/Textures/sheets/bardSpriteSheet.png", >>> 96, 128<<< );
 * 	DEBUGGER threw us into the CONSTRUCTOR, which means we have to look "one Level higher", where we're creating an instance of that class and passing specified values as parameters. 
 *
 *
 * X-Y SCREWUPS
 * 		EPISODE 95 CHASING DOESN'T WORK !  << ERROR was in XY-Screwup :       getY  getY      instead of     getX getY     . Found by Sysouting the values.
 *
 *		EPISODE 36 - Rendering the level. // When replacing the render method I
 * 		accidentally set // this.x = yOffset // this.y = xOffset (mixed x and y
 * 		correspondence) // all controls got twisted e.g. press RIGHT and hero moves
 * 		UP and also rendering got weird :)
 *
 *
 *
 * ACTIVE BUG: 
 * Player keeps moving when u click on another screen, chrome browser for example. 
 * And when u switch back to the game, the movement continues until the button is pressed again in that direction. 
 *
 * EPISODE 74. 
 * Projectiles collide with floor and don't collide with wall. (exact opposite)
 * error was in the condition checker in move() method of WizardProjectile. forgot the "!" sign :)
 * if (!level.tileCollision(x, y, nx, ny, 7)) {
		x += nx;
		y += ny;
		}
 *
 * EPISODE 74. 
 * In Level.java projectiles were not initialized.     " p.init(this); "   solved it   
 *
 * EPISODE 69. Projectiles. 
 * When we tested projectile by shooting grass, it only shot in some angles (looked like 45, 90 degrees). that was because dir (angle of shooting) was set as "int" in Projectile constructor. Obviously, it should be "double", not "int".  
 *
 *
 *
 * EPISODE 58-60 
 * When adding new textures for the spawnlevel, there was a MASSIVE fps drop from 2000 to 400. 
 * It seems that the game is rendering tiles multiple times or something like that.  
 *
 *	Also, when rearranging spritesheet.png, there were different errors:
 *	a) Renders blank squares 
 * 	b) Renders tiles of grass AND black square borders on top of them. It seems like it way rendering two layers of tiles on top of each other. <<<< may be the FPS issue
 * 
 * 
 * When we changed level to spawnlevel, all tiles are void. we have to make sure we READ all the new tiles.  (  getTile method (Level.java)  ) 
 * In fact,  this check in getTile method in Level.java was a source of massive FPS drop :   System.out.println("Good (says Level.java)");  
 * 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * ERROR in a cycle
 * 
 * Когда цикл не работает, проверь, что он не тормозится точкой с запятой
 * 
 * while(x <= 0); { <<< Точка с запятой лишняя !!!
 * 
 * }
 * 
 * 
 * EPISODE 75.  Advanced sprite creation. We render a sprite 'on top' of our pixels array.
 * 
 * ERRONEOUS: 		if (xa < 0 || xa > width || ya < 0 || ya >= height) continue;			// CRASHED after some performance when XA was EQUAL to WIDTH (gave Out of bounds exception in the Display thread)
 * CORRECT: 		if (xa < 0 || xa >= width || ya < 0 || ya >= height) continue;			
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * EPISODE 82. Collision Detection of particles.
 * Particles get "STUCK" in or near the wall.  Basically collision is detected already INSIDE the wall so they particles can't get out anymore
 * This error is due to ROUNDING ! 
 *
